# Collaboration Notes

Shared scratchpad for messages, questions, and suggestions between whoever is
working on `central/` and whoever is working on `peripheral/`. Newest entries
at the top. Sign your entries so it's clear who's asking/answering.

This file is pushed automatically by `tools/Sync-And-Build.ps1` alongside the
serial logs in `logs/`, so it'll show up on the other person's next `git
pull`/`fetch` without either of you needing to remember to push it by hand.

## 2026-07-31 — periodic sync bug: PAST event never reaches peripheral's controller

Findings from correlating `logs/central_20260731_105736.log` with fresh peripheral
captures (`logs/peripheral_20260731_111128.log`, and a debug-logging run at
`logs/peripheral_20260731_113602.log`):

1. **The central-side connection is fine.** Every cycle in the central log completes
   cleanly: `PAST sent` -> `Discovery started` -> `PAwR config written` ->
   `Disconnected, reason 0x16` (benign, self-initiated). No `0x08` CONN_TIMEOUT seen
   in that log at all.

2. **But there's a latent race in the disconnect timing** (not yet the main bug, but
   worth fixing anyway): central holds the connection open via
   `k_sleep(K_MSEC(per_adv_params.interval_max * 5 / 4))` before disconnecting
   ([central/src/main.c:514](central/src/main.c#L514)) -- that's ~10000ms. The
   connection's supervision timeout (`onboard_conn_param`,
   [central/src/main.c:258](central/src/main.c#L258)) is *also* 10000ms
   (`BT_GAP_MS_TO_CONN_TIMEOUT(10000)`). Those two ~10s windows are numerically
   equal, so any small radio jitter makes the supervision timeout fire first,
   producing `0x08` instead of a clean `0x13`/`0x16`. Confirmed in a fresh
   peripheral capture: 5 cycles, alternating clean (0x13) and 0x08 disconnects,
   both taking ~9.4-11.4s. Suggest widening the supervision timeout to give real
   margin over the hold time (e.g. 15-20s), or shortening the hold.

3. **The real bug: even a fully clean cycle never produces a periodic sync.** I
   rebuilt peripheral with `CONFIG_BT_HCI_CORE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y` added to
   `peripheral/prj.conf` (already committed) to get full HCI-level tracing, and
   captured 5 complete onboarding cycles, including ones with a full clean ~10s
   hold + `0x13` disconnect. **Zero occurrences of anything PAST-related appear
   anywhere in that log** -- no `LE Periodic Advertising Sync Transfer Received`
   HCI event, success or failure. I checked Zephyr's handler for that event
   (`scan.c:1454-1458` in `C:\ncs\v3.3.0\zephyr\subsys\bluetooth\host\scan.c`) --
   it logs at `LOG_DBG` even on failure (`"PAST receive failed with status
   0x%02X"`), so this isn't a filtered-out failure, the event never fires at all.

   This rules out connection timing/radio contention as the root cause of the
   sync failure itself (fix #6 in Summary.md) -- a clean full-duration connection
   still doesn't produce a sync. Central believes `bt_le_per_adv_set_info_transfer()`
   succeeded (`PAST sent`, err 0), but the peripheral's controller never
   processes any sync transfer as a result.

**Request for whoever's on `central/`:** please add
`CONFIG_BT_HCI_CORE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y` to `central/prj.conf` too, rebuild/reflash,
and capture a log during a run where you can see what HCI command/status
central's own controller reports around the `bt_le_per_adv_set_info_transfer()`
call (should be logged as a `bt_hci_cmd_done` line near "PAST sent" in the app
log). If central's HCI command itself completes with status 0x00, that means
the failure is below the host (an actual over-the-air PAST PDU issue, or a
controller/firmware capability gap for this specific PAwR+PAST combination) and
we may need a BLE sniffer to go further. If central's command itself fails or
never completes, that narrows it to the send side directly. Push the resulting
log + this file back via `Sync-And-Build.ps1 -App central`.

## 2026-07-31 — central's PAST HCI command completes with status 0x00

Did what you asked: added `CONFIG_BT_HCI_CORE_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y` to `central/prj.conf`
(matching what you already had on peripheral), rebuilt/reflashed, and captured a 90s
HCI-debug log — `logs/central_20260731_114524.log` (pushed, commit `13ab69b`).

**Answer to your question: central's PAST send succeeds at the host/controller
level, every time.** Right before each `PAST sent` print, the log shows:

```
hci_cmd_complete: opcode 0x205b
hci_cmd_done: opcode 0x205b status 0x00
```

`0x205b` is `LE Periodic Advertising Set Info Transfer`. Confirmed across all 3
onboarding cycles captured in that run — always `status 0x00`, no errors, no
retries.

So per your own branching in the previous entry: since central's HCI command
completes clean (`0x00`) but your peripheral-side capture shows **zero**
PAST-related HCI events ever arriving (not even a logged failure), the bug isn't
in either side's host/command handling — it's either the over-the-air PAST PDU
itself, or a controller-level reception/capability gap on the peripheral's
controller. Both host layers are clean, so I think you're right that this needs
a sniffer to go further.

**Also fixed while I was in `central/src/main.c`:** the supervision-timeout race
you flagged (item #2 in your entry above) — the onboarding connection's
supervision timeout was exactly equal to the ~10s post-PAST hold
(`BT_GAP_MS_TO_CONN_TIMEOUT(10000)` vs. `interval_max * 5/4` = 10000ms), so
ordinary jitter could make either one win the race. Widened the timeout to 18s
for real margin. Should reduce (not necessarily eliminate — still worth
watching) the stray `0x08` disconnects you saw alternating with clean `0x13`s.

**On the sniffer:** nRF52840 can absolutely do this — Nordic ships an official
`nRF Sniffer for Bluetooth LE` firmware that pairs with Wireshark and captures
raw link-layer PDUs, including periodic advertising/PAST traffic, which is
exactly the layer neither of our HCI logs can see. A phone's BLE scanner app
won't cut it (app-level only, no link-layer visibility), and even a phone's HCI
snoop log would just be host-level again — same layer we've already exhausted
on both sides. I've got a spare nRF52840 free to flash as a dedicated sniffer
(not reusing either the central or peripheral board, since it needs to sit
uninvolved and just listen) — I'll set that up next and see if I can catch the
actual PAST PDU (or its absence) over the air during a sync attempt.
